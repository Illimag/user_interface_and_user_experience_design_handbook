## Overview

After using the process of applying to jobs with recruiters during the course of 3 months.

Have done around 50-100 interviews in 2-3 months

Did multiple interviews at Google and eBay. These are for contractors for short term positions of 1-12 months. Also there are full time positions at some companies.

As someone who has just started in their career, and is not really aware of the realities of the job market it was a eye opening experience.

For example some people apply to many many jobs and they never get a response for interviews. So even if they wanted to do that many interviews it's difficult to get the resume to a point that the hiring manager schedules an interview.

So that kind of experience would have been a different experience, it can still be many applications sent in just as many but just not as many responses for example it could end up being 1 interview every other week, or 1 interview a week.

Been here as well, for example when just starting out with no job experience, no portfolio, and no certifications applied for 100s of jobs everyday and would not even get 1 interview. This is a tough place to be.

It took 7-8 years to get to a place where finally getting responses from companies such as Google, eBay, Microsoft, Toshiba, Oracle, etc.

But there is still a long way to go, for example some people are so ahead of everyone else that they get multiple offers, and maybe they only have to do a few interviews and each of those interviews turn into offers.

Here are some examples of people and what their job search experience could possibly go.

1. Got internship at Google during college, and another interview at eBay during college, graduated with Bachelor degree in UX Design. Got Master degree in Interaction design. etc etc etc. Great portfolio with client works. Graduated and looking for their first job. 

2. High school diploma, never worked corporate job. Worked various small businesses, freelanced, portfolio with small client works.

3. College degree but unrelated major. If worked during college, worked unrelated job. Portfolio filled with student and personal projects.

4. Industry professional with years of corporate experience working at large brands, etc.

There can be many types of job seekers, and their experience will be very different, and depending on the competitiveness of the industry there can be many types of a certain person.

No matter who you are, and where you are in your job search or career, it's important to understand the nature of competition.

There can be many different types of people and from many types of backgrounds, there is no 100% sure way to make it as a designer. Also there is a place for everyone, and the field is looking for people to fill these positions. Eventually the market fit will be found and as long as you are dedicated and work on yourself, you will find the job that you have always dreamed about.

Also remember that there is always opportunites, as long as you remain open to them.
