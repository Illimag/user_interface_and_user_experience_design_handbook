# Motivation

This chapter is motivation for designers looking for design jobs.

Look.

This is a competitive industry. Sometimes things don't look good, and sometimes it is hard to find the motivation to continue on.

As a fellow designer, here is a pep talk that I hope will give you the motivation to continue on. I know that some in the industry are very crusty and it is tough to get though that tough skin you have developed over the years.

Maybe you have given up many times, after so many rejection, and even finding a design job you are realizing that it isn't as creative as you would have like, you feel like your career should have been better and that there should have been more opportunites for you.

You find it harder and harder to work with your fellow designers, in the roles where the focus should be on the creative aspect and the designs.

You can do it. I believe in you and I believe in the design industry. I believe that designers can solve problems and that there will be continue room for growth.

It's tough to apply for jobs and it's tough to make it in this world, but if you believe in yourself and tough it out you can make it, I promise you. 

Don't feel insecure with what you have accomplished and don't feel like you need to hoard the skills and experience you have gathered over the years. Yes, there is new and upcoming talent whom seem like they are fresh and doing so well, compared to what?

We can share this industry, and build something for everyone, everyone can have a chance, the ones who care are the ones who make it to the top and then builds a better world for the ones still making their journey.

That is my motivation for writing this book. When it was hard for me to make it, though all the negitivity and the doubters. That I also gave up sometimes because of the outside factors whom pressured me day after day to cave in a surrender to their reality of what they invisioned for me.

I stuck it though and as a designer that is the most important part of being a designer. Believing in yourself and not giving up. 

I hope this will be motivation for the right person, whom is always at a crossroad, looking for someone who believes in them.

I want to let you know that I believe in you as a fellow designer, that we can make it happen if we stick through it. And it maybe so hard and difficult, although it could have been easier or harder for some, there are always times no matter who you are when you feel insecure will who you are.

Don't give up on yourself and don't give up on the design industry.
