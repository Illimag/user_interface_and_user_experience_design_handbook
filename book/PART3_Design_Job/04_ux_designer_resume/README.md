# UX Designer Resume

Based on the previous chapter, getting design job secret, a designer can have many different types of resumes over the years. For the lucky few who can get internships during college, and they start with a brand name in their resume right out of college, the path is more straight forward.

For others whom, had to go through a process to even get their first job, it is more difficult.

I would like to share with you the journey to getting to the current iteration of the resume.

This is one of the first resumes that was used to apply for UI/UX Design jobs.

As you can see there is not much experience, as well as the experience being placed in incorrect order.

High Street Market was a grocery store in Itaewon, Seoul, South Korea. So yes, I did put in a job from a grocery story for job applications for UI/UX Designers.

Additionally the experience starts on 2012. The other experiences are also very sparce, such as the instructor for Freshi Media, and then the internship at Uguru, INC for UI/UX Design.

Finally the skills are very low and not specailized as well as putting Industrial Design tools as well.

The next resume is another design, that focuses alot on the personal statement, as well the skills.

Most of the experience and the education which is on the right hand corner, is not very good, as you can see this was before I started as a freelancer, independent contractor.

Here is the resume in another format, with two columns, this format is useful. Note that in western societies it is common for people to read from the left to the right.

As you can see it takes multiple iterations to create the career that you desire. Additionally starting off, resumes will not look great, nor will they have much job experience. But as you can see with effort and continually applying and getting better position, you can slowly climb yourself upwards as a freelancer or as a remote independent contractor. This method is particularlly useful for people who didnt start from the best of places and they are looking for a way to make it in the place that they are from as an UI/UX Designer.
