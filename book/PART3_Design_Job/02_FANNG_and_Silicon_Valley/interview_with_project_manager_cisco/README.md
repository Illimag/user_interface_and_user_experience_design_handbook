Javier:

"Alot of Networking, really, just talking to people.

After the internship was over, I couldnt keep working as desk support

so I started talking to

there was a VP, that gave a talk to the YearUp folk

he said he seemed really cool and I reached out to him again afterwards the talk

and I asked him because I knew that he was closer to project management, i asked him if i could get into that if i could learn if i could follow someone shadow someone so i can know how to become an Project Manger

So from there I started doing it started helping the project managers there and then they liked my work they offered a position

John:

And this was at Ebay?

Javier:

Yeh this was at ebay

John;

and then from ebay you went to paypal?

Javier: 

yep

John: 

and you kept your position as a project manager ?

Javier: 

I was just a project cordinator then, I wasent a project manager yet. I was helpong the project managers. Helping build the spreadsheets, tracking projects, ask the enginners, reporting back to project managers.

John:

And then you went on to work at Google?

Javier:

Everything so far has been contractor. I am 100% at ebay, google and paypal, but im not on their payroll.

John: 

At cisco, this was the role that was remote. This is a remote contractor position.

Javier:

As far as the position goes, the PM, alot position like enginnering, is about experience, so i leverage my experience from previous experience to get to the following companies.

John:

What kind of tools do they use internally for some of these Tech Companies?

Javier:

What do you mean?

John:

Like a custom tool, or like Salesforce?

Javier:

These companies are huge. We are talking about 30,000-40,000 people. 

Remity is something we use to track ticketing.

Smartsheets for tracking.

Puppet

John:

Is there one tool that you just found useful as a PM.

Javier:

Smartsheets. its like Microsoft Projec. You can set milesstones and task and dependencies, so that if you move one of the task, its really simple.

JohnJ:

What kind of responsibility did you have some of these tech companies, at the remote position?

Javier:

Building different softwares, tracking the build of the software, track it and enginnrs have what they need to be successful.

If we are building an application for a specific client we need to know what is going  on with the build, its difficluts for the enginners to focus on coding and also manage conversatiomns with stackholders and leadership, thats where come in to manage those conversations we if anything is anything late or clarifying questions

John:
Overall what kind of experience was that like was it a positive experience?

Javier:

It was a overall positive, very chill.

John:

As a PM that comes from a design background. The reality is that the tech industry is more tech oriented as so there are more technical details.

But were there ever opportunities to be creative and use design while working as a PM in the tech industry?

Javier:

There is alot of stuff like design, I will fire up Illustrator or Photoshop, to modify icons or mockups i want to build for the client, that were working with, so were all on the same page.

We could be descirbing i want this home page have this button here that will take us to a certain part of the database.

I would use something like illustrator to mockup that up.

John:

So that interaction you descibed, of the going to that database, before that interface is there, before you draw somethign, that ideating that interface.

Javier:

We already have an application we are building a portal, where the client reference different databases and create a dashboard where they can look and digest the data, and graphs, and smaller tables that would automotically that feed from databases,

So if we are building that, and we want to click over here do w4e want a drop down of object A, or do we click object A and see all the dashboard and we will break it down it from there.

So big companies have alot of data, they have to work with, even just to know where their servers are, we have over 20,000 servers, 30,000 servers, how do we determine which server goes bad, which server needs to be rebrushied what the health of those servers.

whats the plan?

Huge teams just to work on the database, every base has finance and HR, an design teams that determine we need a server, where are those people going to work from, if we are going to have designers all over the world we need to have server or theres will be a huge latency.

John:

What is the most important thing to getting and keeping a job at a top tier tech company.

Javier:

Dont get too comfortable. Make sure that alwasy eager to help, got to be self driven, if they dont give you a project, start looking into use free time, and look into different things that are going on

So when talking to your manager, do you think we can go into a meeting where we can talk about refreshing the main page of [Cisco.com](http://cisco.com) ?

And you interetersted in that, because they want to know that your interested in what your doing.

Otherwise if you dont show no interest at all and you just go in and clock in and start browing the internet all day you will end up eating the dust.

John:

What are some PROS and CONS of being a contractor and being an employee?

Javier:

So you don't get the benefits of the company, if your not an employee, so you dont get that. And then the reason is cheaper to hire a contractor, if a company wants to get an new employee they need to plan out to how to pay that employee for 5 years. For most companies its like that.

But for contractors for quarterly basis, ok i need contractors for this quarter which is three months, i need someone to build this, i need enginners, they can bring them in as contractors, and its alot easier and less paperwork for them, and also they dont need to pay anyone benifits

John:

What are some PROS of being a COntractor? Getting the contract is OK.

Javier:

I mean your employeed, you get money getting comming in. I also heared you made more money as an contractor than an employee. But I dont know if its true, in my opionion. 

John:

What are some COns of being an employee? Getting stuck or getting too comfortable?

Javier:

Employee have to do quartly performance review, they would have to write up everything they did, and that could get annoying. 

John:

What are the strageties that worked as a remote worker?

Javier:

It depends on which position, as a salesman it could be hard to sell stuff remotely, its all about building a relationship with a client and its difficult with a webcam or just a phone. If you are doing UX work, I feel like, for bigger companies should worry too much, if we were talking to grad students someone just coming out of college type of deals.

You shoulnt worry too much about building huge things or making a humongous impact when going in. Because usually you will just being doing what your manager will be telling you to do. which is, can you just go over there and make follow the guidelines and make the dashboard look like that, and get the icons and make them all match.

John:

That is literally what designers would do.

Javier: 

That is going to do at the lower level, when you become a senior designer, and become a director of design. You will make big decisions, such as what should [cisco.com](http://cisco.com) look like. What is the coolest things, what will bring the most eyes to this website? This is the a more difficult question. They leave that to seniors.

John:

Did you have a design Journey, did you have a heros journey, did the PM journey?

Javier:

I've definitlye switched over time, Ive focus on going up to senior management or VP level, eventually. Trying to aim for that, either the lead of PMO, project management office, alot of big companies have different project management officer, that takes care of all the other project managers bellow. 

To become a Vice President of the department.

John:

So the PM has become a larger part of your journey?

Javier:

Yeh about Project Management, you can become part of the development, you can see the design of the product, and you can see big picture, its alot of resource management.

So you have 5 enginners they can work 5 days a week, so tyhat 5 days a week they are avaiabkle to do someone so you need someone for them to do for 5 days

So we go to the backlog of stuff, and get the piplines, and get the things to make it happen

So I get create that reesource and plan and I tell them what to do during that sprint

John:

So there software enginner, developers, designer, so how does that dynamic work out? Do you guys ever fight?

Javier:

No we dont fight, especially in bigger companies, everyone is very professional there. At smaller companies, I worked for smaller companies, 

John:

Like a startup

Javier:

Not really because it was 3000 people still, because usally you dont need a project manager unless your companies really big. What Project manger is we are an arm of the manager, becuasae the manager will manage 20 project.

They wont be able to see rthe projects, its like a warehouse. They cant manage 100 projects they cant talk to 500 people. its humannly impossible. so they get project managers like us to mange those proiject for them, and they talk to us, and we tell them about the project, and we tell them which enginners which are doing well, or not.

John:

Are latinos and latinas underrepresented in the tech industry?

Javier:

If you asking if there are less latinos than is represented to the population then do think it is lower, what causes that, is another question, there is alot of factors that can go into it, racism is definitly one of them.

John:

Disciminiation? Do you think?Maybe disciminiation? DO you think? Based on skin color and race?

Javier:

I feel like there are alot of clique, like if team if there are alot of indians on a team , or a lot of asians, or a lot of whites, they tend to clique and help each other and protect each other. But then they. If someone is not, of their culture then they dont protect them as much, and they throw them under the bus, so if anything goes wrong that the one they use as the scapegoat, so it depends on the team you join, it sad but its the world we live in.

John:

Why wont they pay benifits, to contractors?

Javier:

Because its cheaper to not do it.

John:

So do you think your expectations were fufillied fror your career and life? From a design background, do you some of the expectaions were met and exceded, where there any that wasent met ye, 

Javier:

I would have to do a masters to get those positions. If you dont have schooling, its hard to get in there. Its harder to get in without it.

John:

SOmething motivation to say, to someone just starting out in their journey?

Javier:

Keep on working on your portfolio build it out dont be afraid to mingle, alwasys ask for openings, doesnth ave to be all job, it could be an intenship, it will be easier than appling through the website, you will be bundled into with 2000 other people, it will be easier to be chosen.
