# Chapter 10: Learning the hard way

## Overview

How to become a designer is not a straight forward path and it is not an easy road.

For example just doing well as school and graduating with a college degree in design is not a guarentee to get a job in the field.

The degree will help as a document to give you crediability.

As someone with no job experience, or no job experience in the field, this credential is very important.

But with only a degree and no job experience, it is difficult for someone to get a entry job in the industry. The reason is because every year more and more people graduate and are in the same boat. They have a degree and they never worked a job and they are looking for that first entry level job in the field. They are looking to break into the field.

If this is you, then getting an entry level job into the field with no job experience and a college degree will be difficult.

But eventually you can get a job if you are dedicated and you try hard to make your way.

Job experience is one of those things where it is hard to know how it will come about. How to get a chance, when no one will give you a chance?

Some of it has to do with luck, for example when starting out it is normal to get rejected 100s or even 1000s of times before you get a chance. 

But once you get that chance, you can leverage it to get another chance, for example now you have job experience. Maybe it was an internship, maybe it was an oppertunity that you created for yourself, maybe it was a family business, maybe it was luck, maybe it was hard work, etc.

But once you receieve that first chance to work, now you can leverage that to find another oppurtunity.

Soon you don't get rejected 1000s of times, instead you get rejected 100 times. 

Many people want to avoid having a hard time for ovious reasons and so they believe they can be prepared and be the best to be able to get the one interview that will lead to the one job.

This could be possible, but realisitically it is a hard goal to reach. The reality is that usually for most people it will require many many tries. 

This is the reality of starting from the ground up, there are some people who understand this and some people do not. For example it could have been an easier process. For example they might have from an earlier age experiencd more success and less rejections than other people. 

As so they might find it hard to believe that some people have difficulties when starting from a place where it is hard to bring yourself to a better place. 

So the reality of the job market is this, for the people who went to college and have gradudated with a degree. That is not a guaratee for a job. There is no real way to be prepared for a job. Because these are not safety certifications to be able to operate hevey machinery. In a creative industry the portfolio is important as a representation of the skillset, style, and a sales tool to close contracts and jobs.

For someone with 20 years of industry experience working with major corporations it can be difficult to have work that they can share outside a NDA. So their experience might be the greatest asset they can share. A portfolio is still a great marketing and sale tool to be able to pitch and present work during an interview.

Once you have the portfolio, the experience, the certifications just sweeten the deal. The certifications make the person even more competitive, so in my opionion.. I would focus on getting into the industry even without a college degree and try to get job experience as fast and as early as possible.

This is a huge benifit because people understand that college degrees are very expensive, so instead of taking out huge student loans, or burden the tax payer it can be better to work and earn money and save money to be able to be able to pay for your own college degree, from the money you earn from working a job.

Because once you get a college degree from the money you earned while working a job, not only will you alread have job experience but you will now have a credential that will help you get a better job. 

Getting a first job or an entry level job shouldn't be a problem. It is only a problem for people who never worked a job in their whole lives and all they have is a college diploma.
