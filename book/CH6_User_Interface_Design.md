## User Interface Design (UI)

User Interface (UI) : Designs of the User Interface in relation to the visual styling and/or functionality of the Interface in various use cases scenarios. Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) for consumer mobile applications and web based application. But not limited to Graphical Interfaces. Interfaces are designed based on the limitations of the devices and the applications that are to be used on particular devices, paramount to understanding the design direction of an User Interface. Limitations on the design of User Interfaces include size of device screen real estate, pixel density of screens, Operating systems of the devices, pre-existing design patterns, computer software frameworks, User Personas Feelings and more. The interaction and the design of that interaction, Interaction Design (IxD) between Humans and Machines, in this particular context, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a deeper understanding of the interactions between the Human User and the Machine Computer, in particular how that User interacts with that machine, and the underlining psychological reasoning behind the User's decision making while the interaction is at play. The methods that said User interacts with the machine, commonly this interaction is facilitated by an User Interface via Web Browser and/or Native Mobile Application.
