# Are UI/UX Designer Portfolios still relevant in 2021?

Here is why UI/UX Designer Portfolios are relevant in 2021, also for any other creative field that requires a thing such as a portfolio. The best way to understand a creative portfolio is by thinking of it as an artist’s self expression of style, and specification. Eventually there will be a certain look that fit a certain company’s design better than another designer who has more experience in another space. 

There are certain looks that certain companies are looking for and it’s difficult to understand the art behind the person, to understanding how a portfolio is a demonstration of the skillsets as well as the methods that the designer or artist used to design a collection of works such as a portfolio.

A portfolio should have a directive or a message, that message could be a demonstration of skillsets, such as advanced design and artistic skill. Also there needs to be certain level of quality across the portfolio pieces. The portfolio piece could be one individual piece, such as an artpiece that is done with watercolor or color pencil, on a canvas. Or a portfolio piece could be a case study for an User Experience design on a Mobile User Interface Web Application. 

For people from a fine art background it is easy to understand why a portfolio will most likely never be a thing that an artist doesnt need. For example they may need it to start applying for art schools in High School. There are certain art schools across the world and in America that require a portfolio to apply to those schools. 

If there is a person going into school for an art major, they sometimes require a portfolio to showcase their understanding of the topic that they are showcasing an interest for. As so for people trying to get into the industry the people who applied for art schools for college already had an art portfolio.

There were many people that I met during high school that took Art I,II,III and AP Art. Some people took those classes for fun, or to learn something that was creative. There were also people that eventually built out a portfolio for themselves during the years of doing creative works, eventually there is collection of various creative artworks that can be used to create a portfolio.

Using this portfolio during High School, art students applied to art colleges. So to join certain art colleges the students require an art portfolio. So for those students it is easy to understand that an art portfolio is what is going to be a significant part of the process. Indeed even the best portfolio cant help a poor student, but a great student wouldnt be considered without a portfolio. 

So in 2021, as designers who work in User Experience designing User Interfaces for Mobile Application and Web Application portfolios are and will continue to be an important part of being a designer.
