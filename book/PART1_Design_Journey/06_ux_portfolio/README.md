# UX Portfolio

## First off what is a UX Design Portfolio and is it important? And if it is important why is it important? Is it possible to not have to have a portfolio?

There are a few trains of thought. There are people who think portfolios are not relevant and there are some people who think portfolios are relevant.

It really depends on what the portfolio is being used for.

Also to try to understand how an UX Designer portfolio can be used.

The earliest time to make a portfolio when back in high school, and even before high school, during after school art classes.

During these after school programs, there were times where I would spend numerous hours possibly around a 3PM-7PM, working on my art pieces at the private art studio.

During this time, I learned how to draw with pencil and use color pencil as well as other mediums, as well as understanding various perspective and abstract concepts.

During these sessions I would draw a piece for a month and spend hours carefully drawing it with pencil and color pencil, and markers, etc. The time would fly by and then the piece would be completed.

After a while there was a collection of art pieces.

When I started high school, I took Art I. Then I took Art II, Art III, and then AP Art.

During school I would draw in class and take extra after school classes at the art studio.

I didnt take art seriously enough and didnt take the AP Art test. Also I didnt have any plans after High School to go to art school, so I didnt have a portfolio ready.

## Many people get stuck around here, not taking the process seriously enough and not applying yourself can be the biggest problems.

But also I didnt know and there were not many people that could help me. I was an immigrant to this country.

I went to Korea and practices more at the art studios, and raised my drawing skill level, but I was never the best at drawing or sketching.

I applyied for Hongik University at Seoul for Industrial Design. There was no portfolio required instead just a entrance exam.

After I returned home to America, I attended De Anza College in Cupertino for Graphic Design. It was a community college so a portfolio was not required to apply.

I prepared to apply to California College of the Arts, and a portfolio was required.

So I prepared a portfolio from all the past works, and applied to California College of the Arts and got in.

The tuition was around 70K per year.

This was the first time that I ever really had a portfolio and the first time I really ever had to use the portfolio.

The portfolio that was used to apply to California College of the Arts, was to get me into the college and a certain level of skill needed to be shown as well as the portfolio being something that showed the interests.

Now after having spent time at CCA studying first Industrial Design, then later Interaction Design.

I took a break from school and appled to jobs around the San Francisco Bay Area.

I didnt have a portfolio all I had was a resume.

I got a job based off of what I could do as a office intern, but eventually it turned into a job related to UX design.

After the internship, I realized I didnt have a way to apply to jobs related to design.

So I created some of my first portfolios for UX.

The first ones were just designs of websites that I wanted to be portfolios.

They were never implemented but the full designs were there.

Also there wasent really a way to show any kind of work that had been done.

After I returned home and sat down and started to do work on a laptop.

What I started to do was to learn how to build a website.

The first website I built was my portfolio website.

This portfolio website was built with HTML/CSS/JS, and it didnt contain any portfolio pieces but rather was a single page of information.

I continued to work on this website.

And eventaully i began to apply to design jobs with this website.

This was back in 2016.

As expected the responses were not very good.

But evntually I got my first client, then I got another client.

But I had to start small, even grass roots type of individuals. But it all worked and i learned over the course of a few years to a few months. 

During the course of 3 years I worked with clients doing small gigs, and learning more about UX Design.

I returned to school at California College of the Arts in San Francisco in 2019, but this time my major was Interaction Design.

Covid-19 began in early 2020.

Over the course of a year or so, I have transfered to Southern New Hamshire University, and I have have worked with a few recent clients and have been putting hours into a portfolio website.

This portfolio website is the collimation of years and years of studying and art and design.

Starting from my first design portfolio to get into California College of the Arts, to the days spent at the art studio putting hours into an art portfolio.

Now I have come to a point where the portfolio I can use to apply for jobs and I am trying to apply to jobs that are 100K.

I believe that with my portfolio I can apply for jobs that are 100K, because during the interview I will use the portfolio to make the best presentation and impression.

After I get the job, I have to do the work and do the tasks that are related to UX and I dont mind at all, and using certain design tools are a breeze, as well as design topics.

This was my journey to creating my UX Design Portfolio, to becoming a 6 figure UX Designer.
