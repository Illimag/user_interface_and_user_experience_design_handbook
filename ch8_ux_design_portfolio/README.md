# Chapter 8: UX Design Portfolio

## Overview

As a designer, your portfolio is one of the main things that have been around since you can remember. If you are looking to make an UX Design Portfolio and you come from a background in Fine Art, making the transition to digitial can be a hurtle.

One of the main things are websites for designers. These website are showcase site of the designer's portfolio, as well as being an opportunity to present their own personal style. 

The best way to have full customizable ability of a portfolio site is to understand the underlining technologies of the site itself. There are also various plugins or online drag and drop builders that allow designers to design their site without using code.

## Custom Portfolio Websites

After my internship as an UI/UX Designer, I spent time putting together my first UI/UX Designer Portfolio. Not only was this my first UI/UX Designer Portfolio, but it was also my first time looking at HTML/CSS/JS. Initally I took templates and made small adjustments to the styling, and eventually I began to understand more fundamental codings such as jquery, as well as bootstrap. 

But being able to build a site without using any kinds of frameworks, as well as no libraries is an important part of understand how website work.

Although it can be difficult with a developer, when a Portfolio Website can be built using a Single Page Web Application methogology then it can present a better finished product to the end user.

## End User

Who is the end user of an UX Designer Portfolio Website?

There can be many different types of Personas that can be invisioned to being interested in an UX Designer's Portfolio.

1. Recruiter

For recruiters, they talk a look at the site at times to just verify that the site does exist to a capacity. From Recruiters, they present job opportunities to designers, and facilitate their career growth in corporate america.

3. Designers

Other Designers are interested in UX Designer's Portfolio. Because designers tend to compare their skills and projects, a portfolio can be a way designers interact with each other in the job market. Also based on each other portfolios, helps designers understand where they are in a spectrum of skillsets.

4. Management

Management can be interested in an UX Designer's Portfolio. Although internal work is a priority, management can look at a Portfolio to see potential places and gain more of an understanding of what the designer is at skillwise as well as their personal styling.

## Final Thoughts

There are more ways than portfolios to showcase work, or skillsets. As designers move further and further along in their journeys they may discover that some of their best projects they can not share on their portfolio or that there are other ways to show skills and styling. 

For designers looking to stay on track with the industry, a maintained and updated portfolio website is one of the best ways to stay relevant in the industry. Being able to show that they are still following industry trends and that they are still revelvant, and modern.

While every designer has their own path, as well as eventually discovering other paths that eventually cause their portfolio to be of less importance. For designers looking to practice and stay relevant in their talents, and skillsets, having a portfolio website is a great way to interact with recruiters, clients, other designers, and management to express your artist talent in a personal way with your own personal portfolio website.
